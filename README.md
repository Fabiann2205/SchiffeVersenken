# Schiffe Versenken - Battleship game

This is my first version of a Battleship (in German: Schiffe Versenken") game.
It has the following features:
- grid size variable (default: 10x10)
- ship sizes and count variable (default: 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1)
- player sets the ships in the beginning by clicking on the grid
- computer sets the ships currently randomized (later there will be an algorithm)
- player and computer attack each others grid by simply clicking on the buttons on the opponents grid
- different colors for fields:
  - water: blue
  - your ships: dark gray
  - missed shots: white
  - hits on opponents ship: red
  - sunk ships: black
- currently the computer shoots on randomized fields (later there will be an algorithm)
- in the end, the winner gets a notification
